A project by Tai Thurber

To run:
    - "python3 Game.py"
    - The program will then ask you to specify whether you want to play in single-player or multiplayer mode
    - The program will then ask you what piece you want to be (either x or o)

- In order to play, select the column that you want to place your piece once prompted.
- A updated board should be printed each time a player makes a move
- The game will terminate once there are no open spots left or someone has won (gotten four-in-a-row)
